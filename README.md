# Dockerizing a React App
# ![Docker + React](./docker-react.png) 
This repository provides a step-by-step guide and code examples for Dockerizing a React app. By containerizing your React application, you can achieve consistent development and seamless deployment across various environments.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Basic familiarity with React and Docker concepts

## Instructions

Follow these steps to Dockerize your React app:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Set up the React app by running the command `npx create-react-app my-app` in your terminal and navigating into the newly created directory `my-app`.
3. Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your React app and copy the provided Dockerfile contents into it.
4. Create a file named `.dockerignore` in the root directory of your React app and copy the provided `.dockerignore` contents into it.
5. Build the Docker image by running `docker build -t my-react-app .` in your terminal (make sure you are in the root directory of your React app).
6. Run the Docker container using the command `docker run -p 3000:3000 my-react-app`.
7. Access your React app by opening a browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Next Steps

If you want to further optimize your Dockerized React app, stay tuned for the upcoming blog post on exploring multi-stage builds with Docker. It will provide insights and practical examples on how to enhance your Docker image and streamline the deployment process.
